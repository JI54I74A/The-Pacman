# The Pacman

Assuming everyone must have played PacMan game in their childhood.
Here is a Pacman simulation created using JavaScript and HTML.
Used minimal inline styling and Bootstrap buttons.
This work is created as a part of MItxPRO fullstack development course.
This was an exercise to figure out the solution for creating PacMans on the screen 
and simutales it's movement. 
During the movement PacMan has to open and close it's mouth, for that four images were given
and part of the code were also provided.

# How to Run

The index.html page contain two buttons
- **ADD PCMAN** : This button is responsible to create PacMan's on the screen.
  we can add as much as we want, the numbers have no limitation
- **START GAME** : By clicking this button the PacMan start to move forward.
  It can also use for incresing the movement speed of PacMan.

There are total 4 images, in that 2 images are for PacMan's forward movement(opening and closing mouth)
and other for backward movement after reaching the maximum screen/window space.
PackMan move inside the screen boundaries up,down,front & back till X & Y axis maximum screen width and heights.

# Road Map

This work can make more interesting by adding additional objects in the screen like food items and PacMan trying to eat that foods.
Everytime PacMan's mouth touches the food it disappers and that PacMan gets point. And some animations and increase more user interactiveness
